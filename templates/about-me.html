            <h1>ADEGBEHINGBE, Oluwakorede Joseph</h1>
            <p>
                I am a computer scientist who recenty graduated from Babcock University. I am also a very passionate and results-driven Python and Flutter developer with over 2 years of hands-on coding experience. I specialize in creating web and mobile applications that not only look great but also deliver exceptional user experiences because I believe that I won't want other people to use a product that I myself won't enjoy.
            </p><br>
            <p>I spend most of my time coding and trying to learn new things. I am always open to trying new things and figuring out how to solve problems as I feel it is very rewarding when I figure out how to solve problems I have never solved before.</p>
